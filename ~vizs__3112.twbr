I love myself, I wanna see it
When I turn around, look in the mirror
And if you don&apos;t like it, you can leave it
&apos;Cause it&apos;s my own and I&apos;ll keep owning it
If you don&apos;t like what I&apos;m wearing
Well, you&apos;re only bothered &apos;cause you&apos;re staring
And you&apos;ll never talk me into caring

I love my ass, I wanna shake it
You can thank my mama &apos;cause she made it
Don&apos;t you waste your breath tryna change it
Just mind your own and I&apos;ll keep owning it
We gotta learn to stick together

Innocent little girls turn you on don&apos;t they?

You like to make them cry
You like to tell them why
You like to grow them up
Swallow hard and throw them up

I would die to hate you
See my heart in my hand
Do you really understand
Get my heart of your hand
Get your hand of my heart

I would die to hate you

But it&apos;s a love thing
You say you got this love thing
You think it&apos;s just a love thing
Fuck your fuckin&apos; love thing

By the way
Your bright eyes are not so encouraging

You want my youth so bad
You love to see me sad
All the sunlight that you say
Can never make it go away
 I would DIE to not care anymore

See my heart in my hand
Do you really understand
Get my heart of your hand
Get your hand of my heart

I would die to hate you

But all I&apos;ve seen of this old world is a bed and a doctor bill
I&apos;m tearing down your brooder house &apos;cause now I&apos;ve got the pill

All these years, I&apos;ve stayed at home while you had all your fun
And every year that&apos;s gone by, another baby&apos;s come
There&apos;s gonna be some changes made right here on Nursery Hill
You&apos;ve set this chicken your last time &apos;cause now I&apos;ve got the pill

This old maternity dress I&apos;ve got is going in the garbage
The clothes I&apos;m wearing from now on won&apos;t take up so much yardage
Miniskirts, hot pants, and a few little fancy frills
Yeah, I&apos;m making up for all those years since I&apos;ve got the pill

I&apos;m tired of all your crowing how you and your hens play
While holding a couple in my arms, another is on the way
This chicken&apos;s done tore up her nest and I&apos;m ready to make a deal
And you can&apos;t afford to turn it down &apos;cause you know I&apos;ve got the pill

This incubator is over-used because you&apos;ve kept it filled
But feeling good comes easy now since I&apos;ve got the pill
It&apos;s getting dark, it&apos;s roosting time, tonight&apos;s too good to be real
Aw, but Daddy don&apos;t you worry none &apos;cause Mama&apos;s got the pill

What&apos;s the matter with your life?
Why you gotta mess with mine?
Don&apos;t keep sweating what I do
&apos;Cause I&apos;m gonna be just fine, check it out

[Chorus: Salt-N-Pepa]
If I wanna take a guy home with me tonight
It&apos;s none of your business
And if she wanna be a freak and sell it on the weekend
It&apos;s none of your business
Now you shouldn&apos;t even get into who I&apos;m giving skins to
It&apos;s none of your business
So don&apos;t try to change my mind, I&apos;ll tell you one more time
It&apos;s none of your business

[Post-Chorus: Salt]
Now who do you think you are
Putting your cheap two cents in?
Don&apos;t you got nothing to do
Than worry &apos;bout my friends? Check it

[Verse 1: Salt]
I can&apos;t do nothing, girl, without somebody bugging
I used to think that it was me, but now I see it wasn&apos;t
They told me to change, they called me names, and so I popped one
Opinions are like assholes and everybody&apos;s got one
I never put my nose where I&apos;m not supposed to
Believe me, if he&apos;s something that I want, I&apos;m stepping closer
I&apos;m not one for playing hypo
Like the high saditty 90210 type of ho
I treat a man like he treats me
The difference between a hooker and a ho ain&apos;t nothing but a fee
So hold your tongue tightly, wish you could be like me
You&apos;re popping all that mess only to stress and to spite me
Now you can get with that or you can get with this
But I don&apos;t give a shit, &apos;cause really it&apos;s none of your business
 [Pre-Chorus]
1993
S-N-P, packing and macking
Bamboozling and smacking suckers with this track, and
Throw the beat back in

[Chorus: Salt-N-Pepa]
If I wanna take a guy home with me tonight
It&apos;s none of your business
And if she wanna be a freak and sell it on the weekend
It&apos;s none of your business
Now you shouldn&apos;t even get into who I&apos;m giving skins to
It&apos;s none of your business
So don&apos;t try to change my mind, I&apos;ll tell you one more time
It&apos;s none of your business

[Post-Chorus: Spinderella]
How many rules am I to break before you understand
That your double-standards don&apos;t mean shit to me?
I know exactly what you say when I turn and walk away
But that&apos;s okay, &apos;cause I don&apos;t let it get it to me
Now every move I make, somebody&apos;s clocking
Don&apos;t ask me nothing, will you just leave me alone?
Never mind who&apos;s the guy that I took home
To bone
[Verse 2: Pepa]
Okay, miss thing, never giving up skins
If you don&apos;t like him or his friends what about that Benz?
Yo, Pep-Pep&apos;s got a ill rep
With all that macaroni trap for rap, you better step
Or better yet, get your head checked
&apos;Cause I refuse to be played like a penny cent trick deck of cards
No, I ain&apos;t hard like the bitches on a boulevard
My face ain&apos;t scarred and I don&apos;t dance in bars
You can call me a tramp if you want to
But I remember the punk who just humped and dumped you
Oh, you can front if you have to
But everybody gets horny just like you
So, yo, so, yo, ho
Check it, double-deck it on the regular butt-naked
Pep&apos;s ass gets respected, miss
But its none of your business

[Chorus: Salt-N-Pepa]
If I wanna take a guy home with me tonight
It&apos;s none of your business
And if she wanna be a freak and sell it on the weekend
It&apos;s none of your business
Now you shouldn&apos;t even get into who I&apos;m giving skins to
It&apos;s none of your business
So don&apos;t try to change my mind, I&apos;ll tell you one more time
It&apos;s none of your business
[Interlude: Salt]
So the moral of this story is
Who are you to judge?
There&apos;s only one true judge, and that&apos;s God
So chill, and let my Father do His job

[Outro: Salt]
&apos;Cause Salt and Pepa&apos;s got it swinging again
&apos;Cause Salt and Pepa&apos;s got it swinging again
&apos;Cause Salt and Pepa&apos;s got it swinging again
&apos;Cause Salt and Pepa&apos;s got it swinging again

I can see you&apos;re disappointed
By the way you look at me
And I&apos;m sorry that I&apos;m not
The woman you thought I&apos;d be

[Verse 2]
Yes, I&apos;ve made my mistakes
But listen and understand
My mistakes are no worse than yours
Just because I&apos;m a woman

[Verse 3]
So when you look at me
Don&apos;t feel sorry for yourself
Just think of all the shame
You might have brought somebody else
Just let me tell you this
Then we&apos;ll both know where we stand

[Bridge]
My mistakes are no worse than yours
Just because I&apos;m a woman

[Verse 4]
Now a man will take a good girl
And he&apos;ll ruin her reputation
But when he wants to marry
Well, that&apos;s a different situation
 [Verse 5]
He&apos;ll just walk off and leave her
To do the best she can
While he looks for an angel
To wear his wedding band

[Verse 6]
Now I know that I&apos;m no angel
If that&apos;s what you thought you&apos;d found
I was just the victim of
A man that lets me down

Why are you hangin&apos; on
So tight
To the rope that I&apos;m hangin&apos; from
Off this island?
This was an escape plan (This was an escape plan)
Carefully timed it
So let me go
And dive into the waves below

[Pre-Chorus]
Who tends the orchards?
Who fixes up the gables?
Emotional torture
From the head of your high table
Who fetches the water
From the rocky mountain spring?
And walk back down again
To feel your words and their sharp sting?
And I&apos;m gettin&apos; fuckin&apos; tired

[Chorus]
The capillaries in my eyes are bursting
If our love died, would that be the worst thing?
For somebody I thought was my saviour
You sure make me do a whole lot of labour
The calloused skin on my hands is crackin&apos;
If our love ends, would that be a bad thing?
And the silence haunts our bed chamber
You make me do too much labour
 [Post-Chorus]
(You make me do too much labour)

[Verse 2]
Apologies from my tongue
Never yours
Busy lapping from flowing cup
And stabbing with your fork
I know you&apos;re a smart man (I know you&apos;re a smart man)
And weaponise
The false incompetence
It&apos;s dominance under guise

[Pre-Chorus]
If we had a daughter
I&apos;d watch and could not save her
The emotional torture
From the head of your high table
She&apos;d do what you taught her
She&apos;d meet the same cruel fate
So now I&apos;ve gotta run
So I can undo this mistake
At least I&apos;ve gotta try

[Chorus]
The capillaries in my eyes are bursting
If our love died, would that be the worst thing?
For somebody I thought was my saviour
You sure make me do a whole lot of labour
The calloused skin on my hands is crackin&apos;
If our love ends, would that be a bad thing?
And the silence haunts our bed chamber
You make me do too much labour

Nymph, then a virgin, nurse, then a servant
Just an appendage, live to attend him
So that he never lifts a finger
24/7 baby machine
So he can live out his picket fence dreams
It&apos;s not an act of love if you make her
You make me do too much labour

Part II: ***Flawless
[Intro: Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie &amp; Beyoncé]
We teach girls to shrink themselves, to make themselves smaller
We say to girls: \&quot;You can have ambition, but not too much
You should aim to be successful, but not too successful
Otherwise, you will threaten the man\&quot;
Because I am female, I am expected to aspire to marriage
I am expected to make my life choices always keeping in mind that marriage is the most important (C-Candy on the ground)
Now, marriage can be a source of joy and love and mutual support (Dum-da-dee-da)
But why do we teach girls to aspire to marriage and we don&apos;t teach boys the same? (Do-da-da, do-do, do-do-do-da)
We raise girls to see each other as competitors
Not for jobs or for accomplishments, which I think can be a good thing (Com-com-comin&apos; down, drippin&apos; candy on the ground)
But for the attention of men
We teach girls that they cannot be sexual beings in the way that boys are (Dum-da-de-da)
Feminist: A person who believes in the social, political, and economic equality of the sexes (Do-da-da, do-do, do-do-do-da)

I don&apos;t give a damn &apos;bout my reputation
The world&apos;s in trouble, there&apos;s no communication
And everyone can say what they wanna say
It never gets better anyway

Why should I care about my bad reputation anyway?
Oh no (No, no, no, no, no, no)

I hate the world today
You&apos;re so good to me, I know, but I can&apos;t change
Tried to tell you but you look at me like maybe
I&apos;m an angel underneath
Innocent and sweet

[Verse 2]
Yesterday I cried
You must have been relieved to see the softer side
I can understand how you&apos;d be so confused
I don&apos;t envy you
I&apos;m a little bit of everything all rolled into one

[Chorus]
I&apos;m a bitch, I&apos;m a lover
I&apos;m a child, I&apos;m a mother
I&apos;m a sinner, I&apos;m a saint
I do not feel ashamed
I&apos;m your Hell, I&apos;m your dream
I&apos;m nothing in between
You know you wouldn&apos;t want it any other way

[Verse 3]
So take me as I am
This may mean you&apos;ll have to be a stronger man
Rest assured that when I start to make you nervous
And I&apos;m going to extremes
Tomorrow I will change and today won&apos;t mean a thing
 [Chorus]
I&apos;m a bitch, I&apos;m a lover
I&apos;m a child, I&apos;m a mother
I&apos;m a sinner, I&apos;m a saint
I do not feel ashamed
I&apos;m your Hell, I&apos;m your dream
I&apos;m nothing in between
You know you wouldn&apos;t want it any other way

[Bridge]
Just when you think you got me figured out
The season&apos;s already changing
I think it&apos;s cool, you do what you do
And don&apos;t try to save me

[Chorus]
I&apos;m a bitch, I&apos;m a lover
I&apos;m a child, I&apos;m a mother
I&apos;m a sinner, I&apos;m a saint
I do not feel ashamed
I&apos;m your Hell, I&apos;m your dream
I&apos;m nothing in between
You know you wouldn&apos;t want it any other way

[Chorus 2]
I&apos;m a bitch, I&apos;m a tease
I&apos;m a goddess on my knees
When you hurt, when you suffer
I&apos;m your angel undercover
I&apos;ve been numb, I&apos;m revived
Can&apos;t say I&apos;m not alive
You know I wouldn&apos;t want it any other way&quot;</bucket>

You have a false idea of ​​love
It was never a contract or an imposition
And although I love you more and more
In a way you can&apos;t even suspect

[Chorus 1]
I am not that woman
Who does not leave the house and who puts the best of his soul at your feet
I will not become the echo of your voice, in a corner
I am not that woman

[Verse 2]
Change the way you think about me
Or you&apos;ll see how you won&apos;t find me here (you&apos;ll find me here)
And even if my heart breaks
I will force you to understand this lesson

[Chorus 2]
I am not that woman
Who does not leave the house and who puts the best of his soul at your feet
I will not become the echo of your voice, in a corner
I am not that woman
That lost girl, the one who signs a paper and gives you her life
You will never see me cry even if I feel like it more than once
I am not that woman

And even if my heart breaks
I&apos;ll force you to understand that lesson

I would be complex, I would be cool
They&apos;d say I played the field before I found someone to commit to
And that would be okay for me to do
Every conquest I had made would make me more of a boss to you

I’m so sick of running as fast as I can

Don&apos;t you think I know exactly where I stand?
This world is forcing me to hold your hand

Well, don&apos;t let me out of your sight
Oh, I&apos;m just a girl, all pretty and petite

Oh, I&apos;ve had it up to here

So many reasons for me to run and hide
I can&apos;t do the little things I hold so dear
&apos;Cause it&apos;s all those little things that I fear

&apos;Cause I&apos;m just a girl, I&apos;d rather not be
&apos;Cause they won&apos;t let me drive late at night
Oh, I&apos;m just a girl, guess I&apos;m some kind of freak

Oh, I&apos;m just a girl, take a good look at me
Just your typical prototype

Oh, I&apos;ve had it up to here
Oh, am I making myself clear?

Oh, I&apos;m just a girl, living in captivity
Your rule of thumb makes me worrisome
Oh, I&apos;m just a girl, what&apos;s my destiny?
What I&apos;ve succumbed to is making me numb
Oh, I&apos;m just a girl, my apologies

Oh, I&apos;m just a girl, lucky me

Cry with the wind, for the dawn is breaking
March, march, swing you along
Wide blows our banner, and hope is waking
Song with its story, dreams with their glory
\&quot;Lo!\&quot; they call, and glad is their word!
Loud and louder it swells
Thunder of freedom, the voice of the Lord!

Long, long—we in the past
Cowered in dread from the light of heaven
Strong, strong—stand we at last
Fearless in faith and with sight new given
Strength with its beauty, life with its duty
(Hear the voice, oh hear and obey!)
These, these—beckon us on!
Open your eyes to the blaze of day

Comrades—ye who have dared
First in the battle to strive and sorrow!
Scorned, spurned—nought have ye cared
Raising your eyes to a wider morrow
Ways that are weary, days that are dreary
Toil and pain by faith ye have borne
Hail, hail—victors ye stand
Wearing the wreath that the brave have worn!

Life, strife—those two are one
Naught can ye win but by faith and daring
On, on—that ye have done
But for the work of today preparing
Firm in reliance, laugh a defiance
(Laugh in hope, for sure is the end)
March, march—many as one

I wanna tell you all a story
About a Harper Valley widowed wife
Who had a teenage daughter
Who attended Harper Valley Junior High
Well, her daughter came home one afternoon
And didn&apos;t even stop to play
And she said, \&quot;Mom, I got a note here
From the Harper Valley PTA\&quot;

[Verse 2]
Well, the note said, \&quot;Mrs. Johnson
You&apos;re wearin&apos; your dresses way too high
It&apos;s reported you&apos;ve been drinking
And a-running &apos;round with men and goin&apos; wild
And we don&apos;t believe you oughta be
A-bringin&apos; up your little girl this way\&quot;
And it was signed by the secretary
Harper Valley PTA

[Verse 3]
Well, it happened that the PTA
Was gonna meet that very afternoon
And they were sure surprised when Mrs. Johnson
Wore her miniskirt into the room
And as she walked up to the blackboard
I can still recall the words she had to say
She said, \&quot;I&apos;d like to address this meeting
Of the Harper Valley PTA\&quot;
 [Verse 4]
\&quot;Well, there&apos;s Bobby Taylor sittin&apos; there
And seven times he&apos;s asked me for a date
And Mrs. Taylor sure seems to use a lotta ice
Whenever he&apos;s away
And, Mr. Baker, can you tell us why
Your secretary had to leave this town?
And shouldn&apos;t widow Jones be told to keep
Her window shades all pulled completely down?\&quot;

[Verse 5]
\&quot;Well, Mr. Harper couldn&apos;t be here
&apos;Cause he stayed too long at Kelly&apos;s Bar again
And if you&apos;ll smell Shirley Thompson&apos;s breath
You&apos;ll find she&apos;s had a little nip of gin
And then you have the nerve to tell me
You think that as a mother I&apos;m not fit
Well, this is just a little Peyton Place
And you&apos;re all Harper Valley hypocrites\&quot;

[Outro]
No, I wouldn&apos;t put you on, because it really did
It happened just this way
The day my mama socked it to
The Harper Valley PTA

              <bucket>&quot;Verse 1
I have a neighbor, one of those
Not very hard to find,
Who know it all without debate
And never change their mind.
I asked him “What of women’s rights,”
He said in tones severe-
“My mind on that is all made up,
Keep woman in her sphere.”

Verse 2
I saw a man in tattered garb
Forth from the grog-shop come;
He squandered all his cash for drink,
And starved his wife at home;
I asked him “Should not woman vote?”
He answered with a sneer-
“I’ve taught my wife to know her place.
Keep woman in her sphere.”

Verse 3
I met an earnest, thoughtful man,
Not many days ago,
Who pondered​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ deep all human law
The honest truth to know;
I asked him “What of woman’s cause!”
The answer came sincere-
“Her rights are just the same as mine,
Let woman choose her sphere.”​​​​&quot;</bucket>

You pull the string, she&apos;s your plaything
You can make her or break her, it&apos;s true
You abuse her, accuse her, turn around and use her
Then forsake her anytime it suits you

[Chorus: Hazel Dickens &amp; Alice Gerrard]
Well, there&apos;s more to her than powder and paint
Than her peroxided, bleached-out hair
Well, if she acts that way, it&apos;s &apos;cause you&apos;ve had your day
Don&apos;t put her down, you helped put her there

[Verse 2: Hazel Dickens]
She hangs around, playin&apos; the clown
While her soul is aching insidе
She&apos;s heartbreak&apos;s child &apos;causе she just lives for your smile
To build her up in a world made by men

[Chorus: Hazel Dickens &amp; Alice Gerrard]
Well, there&apos;s more to her than powder and paint
Than her peroxided, bleached-out hair
Well, if she acts that way, it&apos;s &apos;cause you&apos;ve had your day
Don&apos;t put her down, you helped put her there

[Verse 3: Hazel Dickens]
At the house down the way, you sneak and you pay
For her love, her body, her shame
Then you call yourself a man, you say you just don&apos;t understand
How a woman could turn out that way
 [Chorus: Hazel Dickens &amp; Alice Gerrard]
Well, there&apos;s more to her than powder and paint
Than the men she picks up at the bar
Well, if she acts that way, it&apos;s &apos;cause you&apos;ve had your day

I&apos;ve been runnin&apos; my mouth around the corner
Chasin&apos; it down the street (Bitch)
Cashing my words like I&apos;m a billionaire
But I don&apos;t have food to eat
And I keep talkin&apos; like I&apos;m taller than the trees (Bitch)
But my eyes never see much higher than five feet
And I keep on tellin&apos; everyone the truth
But maybe that&apos;s not the move (Bitch)
And everyone wants to hear a strong opinion
If it&apos;s the same as you (You&apos;re a crazy bitch)
And they say honesty is the best policy (Bitch)
If that were true, don&apos;t think all of my friends would hate me

Mm

[Verse 1: Christina Aguilera]
So, what, am I not &apos;sposed to have an opinion?
Should I keep quiet just because I&apos;m a woman?
Call me a bitch &apos;cause I speak what&apos;s on my mind
Guess it&apos;s easier for you to swallow if I sat and smiled
When a female fires back
Suddenly big talker don&apos;t know how to act
So he does what any little boy would do
Makin&apos; up a few false rumors or two
That for sure is not a man to me
Slanderin&apos; names for popularity
It&apos;s sad you only get your fame through controversy (It&apos;s so sad)
But now it&apos;s time for me to come and give you more to say

[Chorus: Christina Aguilera]
This is for my girls all around the world (Around the world)
Who&apos;ve come across a man that don&apos;t respect your worth (Whoa)
Thinkin&apos; all women should be seen not heard (Whoa)
So what do we do girls? Shout louder!
Lettin&apos; &apos;em know we&apos;re gonna stand our ground (Stand our ground)
Lift your hands high and wave &apos;em proud (Whoa)
Take a deep breath and say it loud (Whoa)
Never can, never will, can&apos;t hold us down
 [Post-Chorus: Christina Aguilera]
Nobody can hold us down (Hold us down)
Nobody can hold us down (Hold us down)
Nobody gonna hold us down (Hold us down)
Never can, never will

[Verse 2: Christina Aguilera]
So, what, am I not &apos;sposed to say what I&apos;m sayin&apos;?
Are you offended with the message I&apos;m bringin&apos;?
Call me whatever &apos;cause your words don&apos;t mean a thing
Guess you ain&apos;t even a man enough to handle what I sing
If you look back in history
It&apos;s a common double standard of society
The guy gets all the glory, the more he can score
While the girl can do the same and yet you call her a whore
I don&apos;t understand why it&apos;s okay
The guy can get away with it, the girl gets named
All my ladies come together and make a change
And start a new beginning for us, everybody sing

[Chorus: Christina Aguilera &amp; Lil&apos; Kim]
This is for my girls all around the world (Around the world) (Yeah)
Who&apos;ve come across a man that don&apos;t respect your worth (Respect your worth)
Thinkin&apos; all women should be seen not heard
(You can&apos;t get rid of us)
So what do we do girls? Shout louder!
Lettin&apos; &apos;em know we&apos;re gonna stand our ground
(We standin&apos; our ground on this one)
Lift your hands high and wave &apos;em proud (Whoa)
Take a deep breath and say it loud
Never can, never will, can&apos;t hold us down (Check it)
[Verse 3: Lil&apos; Kim]
Here&apos;s something I just can&apos;t understand
If a guy have three girls then he&apos;s the man
He can even give her some head, then sex her raw
If a girl do the same, then she&apos;s a whore
But the tables &apos;bout to turn, I bet my fame on it
Cats take my ideas and put they name on it
It&apos;s alright though, you can&apos;t hold me down
I got to keep on movin&apos;
To all my girls with a man who be tryna mack
Do it right back to him and let that be that
You need to let him know that his game is whack
And Lil&apos; Kim and Christina Aguilera got your back

[Bridge: Christina Aguilera]
You&apos;re just a little boy, you think you&apos;re so cute, so coy
You must talk so big, to make up for smaller things
Said you&apos;re just a little boy, all you do is annoy
You must talk so big, to make up for smaller things
This is for my girls!

[Chorus: Christina Aguilera]
This is for my girls all around the world, oh
Who&apos;ve come across a man that don&apos;t respect your worth
(Respect your worth, oh)
Thinkin&apos; all women should be seen not heard
So what do we do girls? Shout louder! (Shout louder!)
Lettin&apos; &apos;em know we&apos;re gonna stand our ground (Stand our ground)
Lift your hands high and wave &apos;em proud (Whoa)
Take a deep breath and say it loud
Never can, never will, can&apos;t hold us down (Whoa)
This is for my girls all around the world (All my girls)
Who&apos;ve come across a man that don&apos;t respect your worth (Around the world)

Instinct leads me to another flow
Every time I hear a brother call a girl a bitch or a ho
Tryna make a sister feel low
You know all of that gots to go
Now everybody knows there&apos;s exceptions to this rule
Now don&apos;t be gettin&apos; mad, when we playin&apos;, it&apos;s cool
But don&apos;t you be calling me out my name
I bring wrath to those who disrespect me like a dame
That&apos;s why I&apos;m talkin&apos;, one day I was walkin&apos; down the block
I had my cutoff shorts on right &apos;cause it was crazy hot
I walked past these dudes when they passed me
One of &apos;em felt my booty, he was nasty
I turned around red, somebody was catchin&apos; the wrath
Then the little one said, \&quot;Ha ha, yeah me, bitch,\&quot; and laughed
Since he was with his boys, he tried to break fly
Huh, I punched him dead in his eye
And said, \&quot;Who you callin&apos; a bitch?\&quot; Yeah!

I hit the bottom, there ain&apos;t nowhere else to go but up
Bad days at work give you an attitude and you erupt
And take it out on me but that&apos;s about enough
You put your hands on me again I&apos;ll put your ass in handcuffs
I guess I fell so deep in love I grew dependent see
I was too blind to see just how it was affectin&apos; me
All that I knew was you was all the man I had
And I was scared to let you go
Even though you treated me bad
But I don’t want to see my kids see me gettin&apos; beat down by daddy smackin&apos; mommy all around
You say I&apos;m nothin&apos; without ya but I&apos;m nothing&apos; with ya
A man don&apos;t really love you if he hits ya
This is my notice to the door, I&apos;m not takin&apos; it no more

But like Yo-Yo, you don&apos;t hear me though
You wear a rag around your head
And you call yourself a \&quot;gangsta bitch\&quot;
Now that you saw Apache&apos;s video
I saw you wildin&apos;, actin&apos; like a fool
I peeped you out the window jumping girls after school
But where did all of this come from?
A minute ago, you was a nerd and nobody ever heard of ya
Now you a wannabe...hard
You barely know your ABC&apos;s, please
There&apos;s plenty of people out there with triggers ready to pull it
Why you tryna jump in front of the bullet (Young lady)?
Uh, and real bad girls are the silent type
Ain&apos;t none of this worth gettin&apos; your face sliced

I&apos;m sure she&apos;d make a really excellent mother

&apos;Cause the love that you gave that we made
Wasn&apos;t able to make it enough for you to be open wide, no

Does she know how you told me
You&apos;d hold me until you died? &apos;Til you died
But you&apos;re still alive

And I&apos;m here to remind you
Of the mess you left when you went away
It&apos;s not fair to deny me
Of the cross I bear that you gave to me
You, you, you oughta know

You seem very well, things look peaceful
I&apos;m not quite as well, I thought you should know
Did you forget about me Mr. Duplicity?
I hate to bug you in the middle of dinner
It was a slap in the face how quickly I was replaced
And are you thinkin&apos; of me when you fuck her?

Wasn&apos;t able to make it enough for you to be open wide, no

&apos;Cause the joke that you laid in the bed that was me
And I&apos;m not gonna fade as soon as you close your eyes
And you know it
And every time I scratch my nails
Down someone else&apos;s back I hope you feel it
Well, can you feel it?

Well, I&apos;m here to remind you
Of the mess you left when you went away

All I&apos;m askin&apos; is for a little respect when you come home
(Just a little bit) Hey baby
(Just a little bit) when you get home
(Just a little bit) mister
(Just a little bit)

[Verse 2]
I ain&apos;t gonna do you wrong while you&apos;re gone
Ain&apos;t gon&apos; do you wrong &apos;cause I don&apos;t wanna

[Chorus]
All I&apos;m askin&apos; is for a little respect when you come home
(Just a little bit) Baby
(Just a little bit) When you get home
(Just a little bit) Yeah
(Just a little bit)

[Verse 3]
I&apos;m about to give you all of my money
And all I&apos;m askin&apos; in return, honey
Is to give me my propers when you get home
 [Refrain]
(Just a, just a, just a, just a) Yeah, baby
(Just a, just a, just a, just a) When you get home
(Just a little bit) Yeah
(Just a little bit)

[Instrumental]

[Verse 4]
Ooh, your kisses, sweeter than honey
And guess what? So is my money

[Chorus 2]
All I want you to do for me, is give it to me when you get home
(Re, re, re, re) Yeah baby
(Re, re, re, re) Whip it to me
(Respect, just a little bit) When you get home, now
(Just a little bit)

[Verse 5]
R-E-S-P-E-C-T, find out what it means to me
R-E-S-P-E-C-T, take care of T-C-B

[Outro]
(Sock it to me, sock it to me, sock it to me, sock it to me)
A little respect
(Sock it to me, sock it to me, sock it to me, sock it to me)
Whoa, babe
(Just a little bit) A little respect
(Just a little bit) I get tired
(Just a little bit) Keep on tryin&apos;
(Just a little bit) You&apos;re runnin&apos; out of fools
(Just a little bit) And I ain&apos;t lyin&apos;
(Just a little bit)
(Re, re, re, re) Start when you come home
(Re, re, re, respect) Or you might walk in
(Just a little bit) And find out I&apos;m gone
(Just a little bit) I gotta have
(Just a little bit) A little respect
(Just a little bit)&quot;</bucket>
