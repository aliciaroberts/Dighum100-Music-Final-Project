Is that supposed to be doing that? Okay, sorry, okay, we're starting now. 
We're Bikini Kill and we want Revolution Girl-style now!

Hey girlfriend
I got a proposition, goes something like this
Dare ya to do what you want

Bratmobile,Love Thing,3,1993,"Admit it;
Innocent little girls turn you on don't they?

You like to make them cry
You like to tell them why
You like to grow them up
Swallow hard and throw them up

I would die to hate you
See my heart in my hand
Do you really understand
Get my heart of your hand
Get your hand of my heart

I would die to hate you

But it's a love thing
You say you got this love thing
You think it's just a love thing
Fuck your fuckin' love thing

By the way
Your bright eyes are not so encouraging

You want my youth so bad
You love to see me sad
All the sunlight that you say
Can never make it go away
 I would DIE to not care anymore

See my heart in my hand
Do you really understand
Get my heart of your hand
Get your hand of my heart

Lunachicks,Bitterness Barbie,3,1995,"Why must I stand on my toes?
Perfect smile and skin tight clothes
Cinched waist, no cunt to piss with
A stamp on my ass
Little girls worship me
And that'll never come to pass
But at last....
I'm turning over a new loaf
I'm eating dry toast
I'm wearing slippers on my flat feet
I have cellulite
Bitterness Barbie, she ain't smiling
Bitterness Barbie, she ain't styling
Bitterness Barbie, boobs are sagging
What if I had a mastectomy?
Would they buy a one titted barbie?
With wiskers, clogged up pores
You know they'd take me out of the stores
Kids don't like me, moms are mad
I'm going off the market cause I look so sad
Bitterness Barbie, she ain't smiling
Bitterness Barbie, she ain't styling
Bitterness Barbie, boobs are sagging
Bitterness Barbie, her ass is dragging
Her ass is dragging, her boobs are sagging
Female pattern baldness befell
Barbie wigs so no one can tell
A barbie with age spots, well I never
Vericose veins would sure be clever
""Pluck my eyebrows"", Barbie today
Shave my toes and back today
Imagine if my eyes were crossed
Or if my hair was grey and course
With a sneer on my face
And a stain in my panties
A hairy crotch, an extra nipple!
I'm turning over a new loaf
I'm eating dry toast
I'm wearing slippers on my flat feet
I have cellulite
Crying tears of Crisco grease
Was I a beauty?
Am I a beast?
Bitterness Barbie, she ain't smiling
Bitterness Barbie, she ain't styling
Bitterness Barbie, boobs are sagging
Bitterness Barbie, her ass is dragging
Her ass is dragging, her boobs are sagging",,,
"Cicely Hamilton, Ethel Smyth ",The March of the Women,1,1910,"Shout, shout, up with your song!
Cry with the wind, for the dawn is breaking
March, march, swing you along
Wide blows our banner, and hope is waking
Song with its story, dreams with their glory
""Lo!"" they call, and glad is their word!
Loud and louder it swells
Thunder of freedom, the voice of the Lord!

Long, long—we in the past
Cowered in dread from the light of heaven
Strong, strong—stand we at last
Fearless in faith and with sight new given
Strength with its beauty, life with its duty
(Hear the voice, oh hear and obey!)
These, these—beckon us on!
Open your eyes to the blaze of day

Comrades—ye who have dared
First in the battle to strive and sorrow!
Scorned, spurned—nought have ye cared
Raising your eyes to a wider morrow
Ways that are weary, days that are dreary
Toil and pain by faith ye have borne
Hail, hail—victors ye stand
Wearing the wreath that the brave have worn!

Life, strife—those two are one
Naught can ye win but by faith and daring
On, on—that ye have done
But for the work of today preparing
Firm in reliance, laugh a defiance
(Laugh in hope, for sure is the end)
March, march—many as one
Shoulder to shoulder and friend to friend",,,
C.C Harrah,The Equal-Rights Banner,1,1884,"Oh say, have you heard of the new, dawning light,
Bringing hope to our land, and its foes all surprising?
Our banner still floats, as the emblem of right,
And the day breaks upon us, for women are rising.
And with ballots in hand, at the right’s dear command,
They’ll be true to the flag and will rescue our land;
And ever the EQUAL-RIGHTS BANNER shall wave
O’er the land of the free and the home of the brave.

How justice and right have been crushed to the dust,
While the foe of the home in protection reposes;
Behind screens, behind bars, and in places of trust,
Not true Freedom, but License its vile form discloses.
The injustice we see, and the women when free
Will destroy by the votes, and then saved shall we be;
And the EQUAL-RIGHTS BANNER forever shall wave
O’er the land of the free, and the home of the brave.

The women for truth and for virtue will stand,
And the country be freed from unjust legislation,
And heav’n then will smile on the purified land,
And the Power shall be praised that hath kept us a nation.
Woman’s ballot is just, so then conquer we must,
And this be our watchword—“In God is Our Trust!”
And our EQUAL-RIGHTS BANNER in triumph shall wave
O’er the land of the free and the home of the brave. ",,,
Edward Christie,Daughters of Freedom,1,1871,"Daughters of Freedom arise in your might,

Instinct leads me to another flow
Every time I hear a brother call a girl a bitch or a ho
Tryna make a sister feel low
You know all of that gots to go
Now everybody knows there's exceptions to this rule
Now don't be gettin' mad, when we playin', it's cool
But don't you be calling me out my name
I bring wrath to those who disrespect me like a dame
That's why I'm talkin', one day I was walkin' down the block
I had my cutoff shorts on right 'cause it was crazy hot
I walked past these dudes when they passed me
One of 'em felt my booty, he was nasty
I turned around red, somebody was catchin' the wrath
Then the little one said, ""Ha ha, yeah me, bitch,"" and laughed
Since he was with his boys, he tried to break fly
Huh, I punched him dead in his eye
And said, ""Who you callin' a bitch?"" Yeah!

I hit the bottom, there ain't nowhere else to go but up
Bad days at work give you an attitude and you erupt
And take it out on me but that's about enough
You put your hands on me again I'll put your ass in handcuffs
I guess I fell so deep in love I grew dependent see
I was too blind to see just how it was affectin' me
All that I knew was you was all the man I had
And I was scared to let you go
Even though you treated me bad
But I don’t want to see my kids see me gettin' beat down by daddy smackin' mommy all around
You say I'm nothin' without ya but I'm nothing' with ya
A man don't really love you if he hits ya
This is my notice to the door, I'm not takin' it no more
I'm not your personal whore, that's not what I'm here for
And nothing good gon' come to ya til you do right by me

I saw you wildin', actin' like a fool
I peeped you out the window jumping girls after school
But where did all of this come from?
A minute ago, you was a nerd and nobody ever heard of ya
Now you a wannabe...hard
You barely know your ABC's, please
There's plenty of people out there with triggers ready to pull it
Why you tryna jump in front of the bullet (Young lady)?

Florence MacAulay,The Women's Marseillaise,1,1909,"Arise, ye daughters of a land
That vaunts its liberty!
Make restless rulers understand

That women will be free.

Who'd be a laggard in the fight?
With victory even now in sight,
And stubborn foemen backward falling.

We swear our fealty
March on! March on!
Face to the dawn,
The dawn of liberty.

Arise! Though pain or loss betide,
Grudge naught of freedom's toll.

Are we of meaner soul?

Their glorious struggle proudly sharing?",,,

[Verse 1: Christina Aguilera]
So, what, am I not 'sposed to have an opinion?
Should I keep quiet just because I'm a woman?
Call me a bitch 'cause I speak what's on my mind
Guess it's easier for you to swallow if I sat and smiled
When a female fires back
Suddenly big talker don't know how to act
So he does what any little boy would do
Makin' up a few false rumors or two
That for sure is not a man to me
Slanderin' names for popularity
It's sad you only get your fame through controversy (It's so sad)
But now it's time for me to come and give you more to say

[Chorus: Christina Aguilera]
This is for my girls all around the world (Around the world)
Who've come across a man that don't respect your worth (Whoa)

Lift your hands high and wave 'em proud (Whoa)
Take a deep breath and say it loud (Whoa)

So, what, am I not 'sposed to say what I'm sayin'?
Are you offended with the message I'm bringin'?
Call me whatever 'cause your words don't mean a thing
Guess you ain't even a man enough to handle what I sing
If you look back in history
It's a common double standard of society
The guy gets all the glory, the more he can score
While the girl can do the same and yet you call her a whore
I don't understand why it's okay
The guy can get away with it, the girl gets named
All my ladies come together and make a change
And start a new beginning for us, everybody sing

Never can, never will, can't hold us down (Check it)
[Verse 3: Lil' Kim]
Here's something I just can't understand
If a guy have three girls then he's the man
He can even give her some head, then sex her raw
If a girl do the same, then she's a whore
But the tables 'bout to turn, I bet my fame on it
Cats take my ideas and put they name on it
It's alright though, you can't hold me down
I got to keep on movin'
To all my girls with a man who be tryna mack
Do it right back to him and let that be that
You need to let him know that his game is whack

Want to move ahead but the boss won't seem to let me
I swear sometimes that man is out to get me

Waitin' for the day your ship'll come in
And the tide's gonna turn an' it's all gonna roll your way

We teach girls to shrink themselves, to make themselves smaller
We say to girls: ""You can have ambition, but not too much
You should aim to be successful, but not too successful
Otherwise, you will threaten the man""
Because I am female, I am expected to aspire to marriage
I am expected to make my life choices always keeping in mind that marriage is the most important (C-Candy on the ground)
Now, marriage can be a source of joy and love and mutual support (Dum-da-dee-da)
But why do we teach girls to aspire to marriage and we don't teach boys the same? (Do-da-da, do-do, do-do-do-da)
We raise girls to see each other as competitors
Not for jobs or for accomplishments, which I think can be a good thing (Com-com-comin' down, drippin' candy on the ground)
But for the attention of men
We teach girls that they cannot be sexual beings in the way that boys are (Dum-da-de-da)
Feminist: A person who believes in the social, political, and economic equality of the sexes (Do-da-da, do-do, do-do-do-da)

If I wanna take a guy home with me tonight
It's none of your business

I can't do nothing, girl, without somebody bugging
I used to think that it was me, but now I see it wasn't
They told me to change, they called me names, and so I popped one
Opinions are like assholes and everybody's got one
I never put my nose where I'm not supposed to
Believe me, if he's something that I want, I'm stepping closer
I'm not one for playing hypo
Like the high saditty 90210 type of ho
I treat a man like he treats me
The difference between a hooker and a ho ain't nothing but a fee
So hold your tongue tightly, wish you could be like me
You're popping all that mess only to stress and to spite me
Now you can get with that or you can get with this
But I don't give a shit, 'cause really it's none of your business

Now every move I make, somebody's clocking
Don't ask me nothing, will you just leave me alone?
Never mind who's the guy that I took home
To bone

Okay, miss thing, never giving up skins
If you don't like him or his friends what about that Benz?
Yo, Pep-Pep's got a ill rep
With all that macaroni trap for rap, you better step
Or better yet, get your head checked
'Cause I refuse to be played like a penny cent trick deck of cards
No, I ain't hard like the bitches on a boulevard
My face ain't scarred and I don't dance in bars
You can call me a tramp if you want to
But I remember the punk who just humped and dumped you
Oh, you can front if you have to
But everybody gets horny just like you
So, yo, so, yo, ho
Check it, double-deck it on the regular butt-naked

Jeannie C. Riley,Harper Valley P.T.A.,2,1968,"[Verse 1]
I wanna tell you all a story
About a Harper Valley widowed wife
Who had a teenage daughter
Who attended Harper Valley Junior High
Well, her daughter came home one afternoon
And didn't even stop to play
And she said, ""Mom, I got a note here
From the Harper Valley PTA""

[Verse 2]
Well, the note said, ""Mrs. Johnson
You're wearin' your dresses way too high
It's reported you've been drinking
And a-running 'round with men and goin' wild
And we don't believe you oughta be
A-bringin' up your little girl this way""
And it was signed by the secretary
Harper Valley PTA

[Verse 3]
Well, it happened that the PTA
Was gonna meet that very afternoon
And they were sure surprised when Mrs. Johnson
Wore her miniskirt into the room
And as she walked up to the blackboard
I can still recall the words she had to say
She said, ""I'd like to address this meeting
Of the Harper Valley PTA""
 [Verse 4]
""Well, there's Bobby Taylor sittin' there
And seven times he's asked me for a date
And Mrs. Taylor sure seems to use a lotta ice
Whenever he's away
And, Mr. Baker, can you tell us why
Your secretary had to leave this town?
And shouldn't widow Jones be told to keep
Her window shades all pulled completely down?""

[Verse 5]
""Well, Mr. Harper couldn't be here
'Cause he stayed too long at Kelly's Bar again
And if you'll smell Shirley Thompson's breath
You'll find she's had a little nip of gin
And then you have the nerve to tell me
You think that as a mother I'm not fit
Well, this is just a little Peyton Place
And you're all Harper Valley hypocrites""

[Outro]
No, I wouldn't put you on, because it really did
It happened just this way
The day my mama socked it to
The Harper Valley PTA
The day my mama socked it to

I would be complex, I would be cool
They'd say I played the field before I found someone to commit to
And that would be okay for me to do
Every conquest I had made would make me more of a boss to you

[Pre-Chorus]
I’d be a fearless leader, I'd be an alpha type
When everyone believes ya, what's that like?

[Chorus]
I’m so sick of running as fast as I can
Wonderin' if I'd get there quicker if I was a man
And I'm so sick of them comin' at me again
'Cause if I was a man, then I'd be the man
I'd be the man (Man)
I’d be the man (Man)

[Verse 2]
They’d say I hustled, put in the work
They wouldn't shake their heads and question how much of this I deserve
What I was wearing, if I was rude
Could all be separated from my good ideas and power moves

[Pre-Chorus]
And they would toast to me, oh (Ayy), let the players play
I’d be just like Leo in Saint-Tropez

[Chorus]
I'm so sick of running as fast as I can
Wonderin' if I'd get there quicker if I was a man
And I’m so sick of them comin' at me again
'Cause if I was a man, then I'd be the man
I'd be the man (Man)
I'd be the man (Man)

What's it like to brag about raking in dollars
And getting bitches and models?
And it's all good if you're bad
And it's okay if you're mad
If I was out flashin' my dollars
I'd be a bitch, not a baller
They'd paint me out to be bad
So it's okay that I'm mad

[Chorus]
I'm so sick of running as fast as I can
Wonderin' if I'd get there quicker if I was a man (You know that)
And I'm so sick of them comin' at me again (Comin' at me again)
'Cause if I was a man (If I was a man), then I'd be the man (Then I'd be the man)
I'm so sick of running as fast as I can (As fast as I can)
Wonderin' if I'd get there quicker if I was a man (Hey)
And I'm so sick of them comin' at me again (Comin' at me again)
'Cause if I was a man (If I was a man), then I'd be the man
I'd be the man (Man)
I'd be the man (Man, oh)
I'd be the man (Man, yeah)
I'd be the man (Man, I'd be the man)

And don't try to make me feel bad
I could talk about every time that you showed up on time
But I'd have an empty line 'cause you never did
Never paid any mind to my mother or friends, so I
Shut 'em all out for you 'cause I was a kid

Bessie Smith,Sam Jones Blues,1,1923,"Lyrics(Spoken: Who's that knockin' on that door? Jones? 
You better get away from that door. I don't know nobody named Jones. 
You're in the right church, brother, but the wrong pew)

Sam Jones left his lawf'ly wife, just to step around
Came back home, 'bout a year
Took it for his high brown
Went to his accustomed shore
And he knocked his knuckles sore
His wife she came, but to his shame
She knew his face no more

Sam said, ""I'm your husband, dear""
But she said, ""Dear, that's strange to hear""
You ain't talkin' to Mrs. Jones
You speakin' to Miss Wilson now
I used to be your lawf'ly mate
But the judge done changed my fate

Was a time you could-a' walked right in
And call this place your home sweet home
But now it's all mine, for all time
I'm free and livin' all alone
Don't need your clothes, don't need your rent
Don't need your ones and twos
Though I ain't rich, I know my stitch
I earned my strutting shoes
Say, hand me the key that unlocks my front door
Because that bell don't read Sam Jones no more, no
You ain't talkin' to Mrs. Jones

Not very hard to find,
Who know it all without debate
And never change their mind.
I asked him “What of women’s rights,”
He said in tones severe-
“My mind on that is all made up,
Keep woman in her sphere.”

Verse 2
I saw a man in tattered garb
Forth from the grog-shop come;
He squandered all his cash for drink,
And starved his wife at home;
I asked him “Should not woman vote?”
He answered with a sneer-
“I’ve taught my wife to know her place.
Keep woman in her sphere.”

I met an earnest, thoughtful man,
Not many days ago,
Who pondered​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ deep all human law

“Her rights are just the same as mine,
Let woman choose her sphere.”​​​​

Society is suckin' on your dick
And since I got a pussy, I'm a bitch
And since you are a dude, yeah, you can tell the truth
But as soon as I do, I'm a bitch

[Bridge]
(If I have to be, I'ma be that bitch)
I'm that motherfuckin' bitch
(If I have to be, I'ma be that bitch)
You should be suckin' on my clit (You're a crazy bitch)
(If I have to be, I'ma be that bitch)
I said, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a bitch
(If I have to be, I'ma be that bitch)
I dare you, stop me

[Chorus]
Society is suckin' on your dick (On your dick)
And since I got a pussy, I'm a bitch (I'm a bitch)
And since you are a dude, yeah, you can tell the truth
But as soon as I do, I'm a bitch
Society is suckin' on your dick (On your dick)
And since I got a pussy, I'm a bitch (I'm a bitch)
And since you are a dude, yeah, you can tell the truth
But as soon as I do, I'm a bitch (You're a crazy bitch)
[Outro]
(If I have to be, I'ma be that bitch)
Watch me
(If I have to be, I'ma be that bitch)
I said, I'll be that bitch
So stop me
Well, that song's done
Song's done, you're done
Fuck! Fuck!
Oh my god! A banger!",,,
EMELINE,what it means to be a girl,3,2022,"[Verse 1]
Fake a smile, fake an orgasm
Fake a laugh, do it all for him
Be polite, spend the night
Call it self-defense
Got the time of his life at my own expense

[Pre-Chorus]
But even if he were my man
He'd never truly understand
What it means to be a girl

[Chorus]
Put ribbons in my curls
Then carry around a knife with my diamonds
It's psycho, we're living in a world
Where I get into clubs because I'm hot as fuck
But I don't trust what's in my cup
That's what it means to be a girl

[Verse 2]
Take his name, give your sanity
Take the blame, put his mind at ease
Trade it all for a false sense of security
Fall in love, fall in line with all his fantasies
 [Pre-Chorus]
But even if he were my man
He'd never truly understand
What it means to be a girl

[Chorus]
Put ribbons in my curls
Then carry around a knife with my diamonds
It's psycho, we're living in a world
Where I get into clubs because I'm hot as fuck
But I don't trust what's in my cup
That's what it means to be a girl

[Bridge]
Fake it till we make everyone happy but ourselves
Use us for our bodies till there's nothing but a shell
It's a mutual experience we're not supposed to tell
And don't act like you have felt
What it means to be a girl

[Chorus]
Put ribbons in my curls
Then carry around a knife with my diamonds
It's psycho, we're living in a world
Where I get into clubs because I'm hot as fuck
But I don't trust what's in my cup
That's what it means to be a girl
[Outro]
What it means to be a girl
Ah-aah
What it means to be a girl
Ah-aah",,,

My mama always told me that I'd make it

Hailey Orion,When Will I Be Mine?,3,2022,"[Verse 1]
Little girls can't be girls when there's men outside
I remember the first time I was sexualized
I was 8 years old riding on my bike
And I was in a swimsuit 'cause it was hot outside
I thought when I grew up into my teenage years
I would have more luck I'd have nothing to fear
Till I was assaulted and frowned upon by my peers
I was faulted for the way I appeared
I'm not suprised
Men take what isn't theirs but what pleases
Women, land, money, natives in the namе of Jesus
I'm not suprised my rights werе taken under the guise of a fetus
They want to protect the children but not when they actually need us
Not when they're gay, trans, homeless, poor or when they disagree
Only when they're in the womb but not when they're out in the streets
Abortion is illegal for poor women of color
But what would you do for your white, wealthy mother?
Would you watch her bleed out on the table from an ectopic pregnancy?
Watch her give birth to a baby from a forced rapist's seed?
What about your little sister who had sex for the first time?
Aren't contraceptives the next thing you want to take from our rights?
So she gets pregnant at 15, changes her whole life
If she survives
But she never got the chance to decide
No, I'm not suprised
My body?
It's never been mine

[Hook]
When will I be mine?
When will I be mine?
When will I be mine?
When will I be...

[Verse 2]
I'm tired of the argument, not all men
If it's not you, who is it then?
All the good men in my life fit on one hand
And for all you being quiet I wish you'd take a stand
'Cause it's not all men, but it is all women
Since 1998 it's been about 18 million
And that's just rape
Not cat calling or hands that explore
Or those who were afraid to report
You think I'm only talking 'bout Brock Turner's in alleyways?
He got 6 months then got out in 3 months anyways
Not every malicious man only attacks in the dark
Most the time it's thos you've known sinc you were in head start
It's all the boys that swore they were joking with their friends
But then grew up to view us as means to an end
It's a culture that runs deeper than we're willing to admit
It's the way girls are raised to obey and submit
It's our porn, movies, tv, songs, written in our history
Couldn't even have our own credit cards till 1970's
And look at us now changing the 14th amendment
Tryna pretend wow it'll really make a positive difference
But when we're born we're forced to look through other's eyes
How do I appear, speak, act, what is today's compromise?
I'm a whore or I'm a saint but both of those you despise
And then you want to bring a baby here and say surprise
Your body?
It's mine
[Hook]
When will I be mine?
When will I be mine?
When will I be mine?
When will I be...

[Bridge]
I spoke in a moment of frustration
But I stood in awe at all of your relation
I couldn't tell you how many times I read
When I was 8
When I was 4
When I was 10
I'm sorry you've been where I've been
And if I could be with you now I'd tell you it's okay
But with the way things are going I know we don't feel safe
So I ask you if you do relate
Scream it from the top of your lungs and don't hesitate

[Hook]
When will I be mine?
When will I be mine?
When will I be mine?
When will I be...
